# Purpose:
# This script simply runs a command with Inkscape to convert a file from svg to
# eps, and then runs another command with pstoedit to convert it from eps to
# dxf.

# Requirements:
# You will need to install Inkscape and pstoedit and make sure they are both
# added to your PATH. On most linux distributions you should be able to use apt
# or similar to install the packages, on MacOSX you may need to use something
# like ports to install pstoedit then manually add the PATH.
